•An interval X of numbers is called sum-free if the sum of two elements of X never belongs to X.
•the interval [5, . . . , 9] is sum-free; the interval [4, . . . , 9] is not (4 + 4 = 8, 4 + 5 = 9).
The Schur number S(k) is the largest integer n for which the interval [1,n] can be partitioned into k sum-free sets.

Idea: write a program for checking if a number n is the S(k) number
•no answer sets means that S(k)=n-1
•Otherwise, S(k)>=n

Representation:
•the number of sets and the interval
•The assignment of numbers to sets
Generating a possible solution:
•Partition {1 ,.. , n } intok subsets.

Checking for a solution via constraints:
•subsets haveto be sum - free
No many Schur numbers are known:
  S(1)=1, S(2)=4, S(3)=13, S(4)=44, S(5)>=160.
